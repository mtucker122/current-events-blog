We The People: UnscriptedBlog #1 – June 10, 2025The Stories We Don't Tell About Immigration

INTRO TAGLINE (FOR VIDEO & BLOG):This is We The People—where we cut through the noise and talk about what really matters.

So what happens when We The People talk about immigration, but not about who is actually doing the work?

You get the conversation we are having right now.All politics. No reality.

This is exactly the kind of tough conversation we need if we are serious about being a country that works for real people, not just political theater.And immigration? That is the perfect place to start.

Walk into any kitchen in America.Drive past a construction site.Look at the crews harvesting food in the fields.Visit a hospital.Explore the tech labs and classrooms that power innovation.

The people doing this essential work—from blue collar to white collar—many of them are immigrants.

We know it. We see it.But when we debate immigration, we ignore the economic truth staring us in the face.

The Numbers We Ignore

Here is what business leaders admit when the cameras are off:They rely on immigrant labor.

Not because they are trying to exploit anyone.But because these are jobs that need doing, and immigrants are willing to do them.

Here is what might surprise you: undocumented immigrants alone paid nearly $90 billion in taxes in 2023.That is $33.9 billion to state and local governments, and $55.8 billion to the federal government.

Taxes. Paid on income they are supposedly not even allowed to have.

Agriculture. Construction. Food service. Healthcare support. Hospitality.Foreign-born workers make up 18.6% of the U.S. labor force.That is 29 million people doing the work that keeps this country running.

And they are not just employees.Many are entrepreneurs, starting businesses, creating jobs, fueling communities.

Yet we continue to talk about immigration like it exists in a vacuum, as if it is disconnected from the labor and services we depend on every day.

Then vs. Now

Great-grandfathers once stepped off boats with twelve dollars and spoke no English.Sound familiar?

Back then, we called it the American Dream.Ellis Island was a beacon of hope.Families saved for years for a shot at that promise.

So what changed?

The immigrants then were mostly European.White faces from Ireland, Italy, Poland, Germany.

They faced discrimination too.“No Irish Need Apply” signs were real.But over time, they were welcomed into the American story.

Today’s immigrants are mostly people of color.From Latin America, the Caribbean, Africa, and Asia.

Let us be honest about what that difference means.Because if some people cannot face uncomfortable truths, they are not ready for the conversations this country needs.

The Uncomfortable Truth

The way we talk about immigration did not change because immigrants changed.The desperation is the same.The hope is the same.The willingness to work impossible hours for a better life—that is the same too.

What changed was the color of the people arriving.

When the immigrants were European, we built statues and spoke of dreams.Now, with immigrants of color, we build walls and speak of invasions.

Same economic needs.Same human dreams.Different skin color.Different response.

If that truth makes you uncomfortable—good.That is where growth begins.

Because We The People includes all of us.And that means facing the truth about how we treat one another.

The Myths That Don’t Hold Up

“But immigrants bring crime.”Except they do not.

Study after study shows that immigrants—including undocumented ones—commit crimes at lower rates than native-born Americans.

Cities with large immigrant populations tend to be safer, not more dangerous.Border towns are not war zones, despite what you see on cable news.

“They are taking our jobs.”Which jobs exactly?

The roofing jobs in 110-degree heat?The overnight shifts in meatpacking plants?The agricultural jobs that require being bent over in a field for ten hours?

These are not jobs being stolen.These are jobs that need doing—jobs many Americans will not or cannot take.

Mass deportation would not create employment.It would crash major sectors of our economy.

We would lose billions in tax revenue.Consumer spending would plummet.Entire industries would be pushed to the brink.

And maybe the question we should ask is this:Why do so many jobs in America pay so little that no one wants them?

But that is a conversation for another day.

What This Actually Costs

Our current approach to immigration is costing We The People far more than we admit.

Families are torn apart.Children grow up afraid their parents might not come home from work.

People live in shadows, afraid to report crimes or seek protection.Businesses operate in legal gray zones, unsure if their workforce will still be there tomorrow.

And communities fracture.

We depend on immigrant labor.We benefit from it.And yet we demonize the very people doing the work.

That is not sustainable.That is not just.And it is certainly not what We The People should stand for.

The Real Question

The question is not whether we need immigration.Our economy already answered that.

The real question is:Are we willing to acknowledge reality and build systems that work?Or will we keep pretending that the people harvesting our food and building our homes do not exist?

Will we treat immigrants like the human beings they are?People chasing something better for their families.People living the same American dream our ancestors did.

Because the difference between then and now?It is not about economics.It is not about crime.It is not about culture.

It is about race.

And until we are honest about that,we are not having a real conversation about immigration.

Because We The People means all of us.Every single one of us.Trying to build something better, together.

Call to Action

What tough conversation do you think We The People needs to have next?What keeps you up at night that no one is talking about?

Share your thoughts.Keep it real.Keep it respectful.That is how we do things here.
